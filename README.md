# Video Processor Tool

This project is a Python-based tool for handling basic video processing operations such as loading, trimming, and validating video files. It uses the `MoviePy` library and includes utility functions for logging and error handling.

## Features
- **Load Video**: Display metadata such as duration, frame rate, and resolution.
- **Trim Video**: Extract a specific portion of a video based on start and end times.
- **File Validation**: Check the existence and format of video files.
- **Logging**: Maintain logs for all operations and errors.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- Libraries:
  - `MoviePy`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/video-processor.git
   cd video-processor
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv videoenv
   source videoenv/bin/activate   # On Windows: videoenv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
### Video Handler
`video_handler.py` handles video loading and trimming. Example:

```bash
python src/video_handler.py
```

This script will:
1. Load a sample video from `sample_videos/input/sample_video.mp4`.
2. Display its metadata (e.g., duration, frame rate, resolution).
3. Trim the video from 5s to 10s and save the result in `sample_videos/output/trimmed_video.mp4`.

### Video Utils
`video_utils.py` includes utility functions for:
- Setting up logs in the `logs/processing_logs.txt` file.
- Validating the existence and format of video files.

## Examples
### Loading a Video
```python
from video_handler import load_video

video_path = "sample_videos/input/sample_video.mp4"
video = load_video(video_path)
```

### Trimming a Video
```python
from video_handler import trim_video

trimmed_video = trim_video(video, start_time=5, end_time=10)
```

### Logging and Validation
```python
from video_utils import setup_logging, check_video_file

setup_logging()
if check_video_file("sample_videos/input/sample_video.mp4"):
    print("File exists and is valid.")
```

## Logs
All logs are saved in the `logs/processing_logs.txt` file. The logs include:
- Operation details.
- Errors encountered during execution.

## Task Details
This project is part of a learning task, focusing on **video file processing fundamentals**. The key objectives were:
- Loading video files.
- Performing basic operations like trimming.
- Saving processed videos.
- Logging and error handling.
